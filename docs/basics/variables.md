## Variables

Now that you're ready to begin coding, let's start at the top. What exactly is a variable, and why would you ever use or need one?

Example #1:
```php
<?php

$greetings = "Hello World";

echo $greetings;
```
Output: `Hello World`

Example #2:
```php
<?php

$text = "My";
$age = 21;

echo "$text age is {$age}";
```
Output: `My age is 21`

Example #3:
```php
<?php

$name = "Shaik Rasool";

echo 'My name is ' . $name;
```
Output: `My name is Shaik Rasool`
