## Variables

Now that you're ready to begin coding, let's start at the top. What exactly is a variable, and why would you ever use or need one?

Example #1:

```
<?php

$greetings = "Hello World";

echo $greetings;
```

Output:

```
Hello World
```

Example #2:

```
<?php

$name = "Shaik Rasool";

echo "Hello, $name";
```

Output:

```
Hello, Shaik Rasool
```

Example #3:

```
<?php

$name = "Shaik Rasool";

echo 'My name is ' . $name;
```

Output:

```
